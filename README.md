## 📋 Data Standards

**Tiers** indicate the **minimum** plan level where features are available:
- `free` - Available without payment
- `paid` - Available on mid-tier plans (Business, Pro, etc.)
- `enterprise` - Top tier only (usually requires sales contact)

**SCIM levels:**
- `full` - Complete SCIM 2.0 (users + groups)
- `partial` - Limited (often read-only or users-only)
- `none` - No SCIM support

All data is verified from official sources and includes a `last_verified` date.
